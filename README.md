## Building (Linux)

### Release

Recommended Compiler: `GCC`

Recommended Standard: `C11`

Dependencies:
- [`JSON-C`](https://github.com/json-c/json-c)

```
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ..
make
```

upon successful compilation, the binary executable along with config files are found in `release` (`bin/release`) folder.

### Debug

```
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
```

upon successful compilation, the binary executable along with config files are found in `debug` (`bin/debug`) folder.

### Building on Windows

* Install [JSON-C](https://github.com/json-c/json-c#building-on-unix-and-windows-with-vcpkg-)
* [Install C and C++ support in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=vs-2019)
* Install [TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/)

`include` path is set to `C:/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/include` in `CMakeLists.txt`. Edit the path if you installed `vcpkg` in some other directory.

`lib` path is set to `C:/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/lib` in `CMakeLists.txt`. Edit the path if you installed `vcpkg` in some other directory.

```
